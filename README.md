## Description ##
Configuration Management with Ansible.

## Purpose ##
- Automating Build of Multi-Tier Java Web Application on Premises Using Ansible Playbooks.
- Leveraging Ansible's powerful automation capabilities.
- Define and manage configurations of servers, network devices, and other infrastructure components through code.
- Implement a configuration management system using Ansible.
- Automate tasks such as software installations, security hardening, and system updates.
- Create virtual machines for each service using Vagrant and automate the configuration process using Ansible playbook.

## Tools ##
- Vagrant: For virtual machine management.
- VirtualBox or VMware: Hypervisor software for running virtual machines.
- Ansible: Automation tool for configuration management.
- Tomcat: Servlet container for Java web applications.
- Nginx: Web server and reverse proxy.
- RabbitMQ: Message broker for asynchronous communication.
- Memcached: Distributed memory caching system.
- MySQL: Relational database management system.
- Maven: Build automation tool for Java projects.
- Git: Version control system.

## Project Steps ##
- Setup Environment: Install and configure Vagrant, VirtualBox or VMware.
- Install Ansible: Begin by installing Ansible on your control/master node.
- Set up Inventory: Create an inventory file that lists all the hosts you want to manage with Ansible. (You can specify hosts by IP address or domain name and organize them into groups for easier management).
- Create Configuration File: Define the desired configurations for each system and create configuration files using the appropriate syntax and format supported by your chosen configuration management tool.
- Define Roles: Organize tasks into roles for better organization and reusability. Define separate roles for configuring Tomcat, Nginx, RabbitMQ, Memcached, MySQL, Maven, and Git.
- Write Playbooks: Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define the tasks you want to automate. Write playbooks to define configurations, tasks, and roles for your infrastructure components.
- Configure Virtual Machines: Execute the Ansible playbook to automate the configuration process. Ensure proper connectivity between the services.
- Task Automation: Identify common tasks that can be automated, such as software installations, security hardening, and system updates. Write scripts/playbooks or use pre-built modules provided by the configuration management tool to automate these tasks.
- Provisioning and Deployment: Use the configuration management tool to provision and deploy the configurations to the target systems. This involves connecting to the systems and applying the defined configurations.
- Integration: Integrate the services to form a multi-tier architecture using Ansible. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests to Tomcat. Set up RabbitMQ for communication between different components of the application.
- Deployment: Deploy the Java web application on Tomcat using Ansible playbook. Configure Nginx to serve static content and route requests to Tomcat.
- Testing: Test the functionality of the web application deployed on the configured infrastructure.
- Documentation: Document the steps taken during the project, including the Ansible playbook, roles, configurations, and any troubleshooting techniques used.
